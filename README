JOb Queue
niko 2010

as its name seems to indicate, joq manage jobs queue!

a queue can run a parametizabled number of jobs simultaneously.

a job can be shell code or perl code/class, and have many parameters such as when to start (at a time, after a time, after other jobs, etc...), log, priority, and nice.

there's more than one way to supervise joq : telnet, command line tool joq-client, or programatically with perl and joq::client.
joq can be linked to others joqs, and job can be added to all sync'ed joq at a time.
