JOb Queue
niko 2010-2012

## DESCRIPTION

as its name seems to indicate, joq manage a jobs queue!

this queue can run a parametizabled number of jobs simultaneously.
a job can be shell code or perl code/class, and have many parameters such as when to start (at a time, after a time, after other jobs, etc...), log, priority, and nice.

there's more than one way to supervise joq : telnet, command line tool joq-client, or programatically with perl and joq::client.

## QUICK START

bin/joq --help  #show options
bin/joq --demo  #show a short demo
bin/joq         #start a foreground joq with default options

## CONFIG

by default joq can start
config file are in json or yaml.
sample config file :

{
  "polling": 2,
  "server": "off",
  "oneshot": 0,
  "log": {
	  "level": "NOTICE",
	  "file": "/var/log/joq.log",
    "console": "color"
  },
  "jobs": [
    { "name":"foo", "shell":"ls", "args":"/", "when": { "delay":0 } },
    { "code":"for(qw/un deux trois quatre cinq/){ print "$_\n"; sleep 1 }" },
    { "shell":"echo 'bar'", "when": {"after":"foo"} }
  ]
}

jobs must have at least a class, code, or shell parameter.

## JOBS OPTIONS

  name     = "jobname" (default=first word of class/code/shell)
  shell    = cmd
  nice     = int -20(fast) > 19(slow)
  class    = perl class::name with ->new and ->run([args]) methods
  package  = perl class::name to use
  args     = array of arguments given to the class
  code     = perl_code_to_eval
  priority = 1-10 (1=slow,10=speed,default=5) 
  logfile  = filename for job log output
  timeout  = duration* (default=unlimited)
  when     = {
     dayofweek:  "all|sat,mon,1-7" 1=monday, time:"hh:mm,hh:mm,.."
     dayofmonth: "all|1-31,...", time:"hh:mm,hh:mm,..."
     dayofyear: "all|1-365,...", time:"hh:mm,hh:mm,..."
     repeat: duration*
     after: "job1 or job2 and job3"
     start: "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm"
     if: perl_code_to_eval as start condition
     delay: duration*
     count: nbtime
  } default={ count:1 }

*duration can be expressed as 12 / 12s / 2m / 5h

## SUPERVISION

#with a command line
bin/joq-client status
bin/joq-client list
bin/joq-client show jobname

#with telnet
telnet localhost 1970
